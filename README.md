# 🍕 Pizza-Shop Java Project

Welcome to **Pizza-Shop** — a Java-based console application developed as part of a programming module in the MSc Software Development course at **Queen’s University Belfast**. This project was created as a hands-on exercise to explore core Java concepts, object-oriented programming, and console I/O functionality.

## 📘 About the Project

The Pizza-Shop app simulates a simple ordering system for a pizza store. It’s built entirely with Java and designed to reinforce foundational skills such as:

- Class and object creation
- Control structures (loops, conditionals)
- Array usage
- User input handling via `Scanner`
- Console output formatting

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Piranes1/Pizza-Shop.git
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE (e.g., Eclipse).
3. Run the main class (PizzaShop.java) to start the console application.

Ensure that you have Java 8 or higher installed.

## 🛠️ Features
- Menu selection and user interaction via command line
- Basic data structures and method implementation
- Console-driven input/output logic
- Modular code structure ready for expansion (e.g., GUI, file storage)

## 📦 Future Enhancements (Ideas)
- Add graphical user interface (GUI) using JavaFX or Swing
- Integrate order persistence via file I/O or databases
- Implement pricing and inventory features
- Extend to support multiple pizza types and customization
